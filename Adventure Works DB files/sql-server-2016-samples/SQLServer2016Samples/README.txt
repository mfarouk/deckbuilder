Samples for SQL Server 2016

Subfolders contain samples that highlight the new features in SQL Server 2016. Most of the samples use AdventureWorks2016_EXT or AdventureWorksDW2016_EXT.
To run the queries in .sql files, open SQL Server Management Studio, connect to the SQL Server 2016 instance, and open the .sql file by clicking File->Open->File and navigating to the .sql file you wish to open.
